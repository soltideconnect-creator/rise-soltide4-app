<h1>Privacy Policy – Rise: Habit Tracker and Smart Sleep</h1>
<p><strong>Last updated: 30 November 2025</strong></p>
<p>All data you create in <strong>Rise: Habit Tracker and Smart Sleep</strong> (habits, streaks, sleep recordings, notes, etc.) is stored <strong>only locally on your device</strong> using the browser's secure storage (IndexedDB / localStorage). Your data is never uploaded to any server, cloud, or third party.</p>
<p>The developer — <strong>Solomon Awotide</strong> (soltideconnect@gmail.com) — does not have access to your personal information and cannot view, collect, or share it under any circumstances.</p>
<p>Rise contains <strong>no advertisement networks, no third-party analytics</strong> (such as Google Analytics, Facebook SDK, Mixpanel, Amplitude, etc.), and no tracking pixels.</p>
<h3>Android Backup Note (Google Play version only)</h3>
<p>If you have enabled "Back up my data" in your Android settings (Settings → System → Backup), Google itself (not Rise) may create periodic encrypted backups of your device data to Google Drive. This is a standard Android feature and is completely outside the control of Rise or its developer. You can disable it at any time in your phone settings.</p>

  <li><strong>Microphone &amp; Motion sensors</strong> – used only for the optional premium Sleep Tracker &amp; Smart Alarm features (never active without your explicit consent).</li>
  <li><strong>No internet permission</strong> is required or requested after installation – everything works 100 % offline.</li>
